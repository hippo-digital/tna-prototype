It covers the years 1834 to 1900.  Poor law unions were collections or groups of parishes brought together to administer poor relief. Earlier 'unions' were refered to as 'incorporations' and some of these existed until the 1860s (which is why for some areas there are no correspondence until the old incorporation was dissolved and the new union organised).  The Victorian poor law was predicated on the 'workhouse test'. This is where poor relief would be offered via the 'deterrent workhouse', designed to be an institution of last resort. Most Victorian workhouses were built in the late 1830s/early 1840s. However, a small number were built later and many additions were made to existing workhouses throughout the ninteenth and twentieth centuries.  The papers range through the whole field of poor law and (after 1871) local government and public health administration. The material will refer to all aspects of poor relief; workhouse administration, finance, indoor- and outdoor poor relief, information on individual paupers etc.  Digital copies of selected 19th Century Poor Law Union and Workhouse records from MH 12 can be searched and downloaded. The research guide Poverty and the Poor Laws lists the poor law unions which have been digitised and are available through Discovery."	1834-1900	16741 volume(s)		Most of the papers after 1900 were destroyed by enemy action in 1941 or fire in 1944; those which have survived have been incorporated in various MH or HLG series.

Initially, they were issued from 1853-1858 in a numbered sequence covering 1853 to 1855 and separate numbered sequences for 1856, 1857 and 1858. In 1859 a prefix (letter O or number nought) was introduced which was used in a single sequence until 1886 when a series with an A prefix was introduced (paper O 1016 was followed by paper A16).  There were also separate B and C series of papers, but the latter (which by the 1940's was reserved for papers classified 'confidential') does not survive as a distinct set.  There were also other serial numbers in use for secret and confidential papers, usually those originating in other departments. Such documents will normally be found in the records of the originating department.  Material originally assigned to WO 130, which was abolished in June 1969, is now WO 33/1574-1623; the other papers fomerly in WO 130 largely duplicated material already in WO 33."	1853-1969	3409 files and volumes			"For related printed material see WO 279; See also Records of Commissions, Committees and Councils, etc ; For other A papers, relating to the Second World War, many of which will have copies in this series, see WO 212"		Normal Closure before FOI Act: 	30		C14242
