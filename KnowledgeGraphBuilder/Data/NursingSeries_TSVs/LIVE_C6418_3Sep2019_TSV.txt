>>>    	DT 12			General Nursing Council for England and Wales: Registration: Computerised Register and Roll	Prints on papers and films on fiche of the General Nursing Council's register and rolls, and lists of the different categories of nurses. ¶ The main document in this series is a laser print from the computer tape containing the names of those nurses still on the register and roll in 1983, from the opening of the register on 30 September 1921 to the dissolution of the GNC at close of business on 30 June 1983. It does not include the list of nurses and it does not contain the names of nurses: ¶ known to be dead * removed by order of the Disciplinary Committee, who might be restored later * who failed to pay the consolidated retention fee, who might be re-included later * who were enrolled by virtue of having passed the final practical examination for registration (enrolment by direct entry), or who were later registered and had allowed their enrolment to lapse. This occurred from 1969 onwards. ¶ Also included in this series are three sets of microfiche (DT12/24-26) produced by the batch maintenance computer system. Under this system, up-dating of records was managed by sending a batch of information on changes and additions to the computer bureau and receiving in return, nine times a year, an up-dated microfiche. The microfiche in this series are the last silver halide masters to be produced (DT12/25-26) and the earliest surviving diazo print (DT12/24). They contain information, such as full name and training school, not found in the print-out.	1973-1983	28 microform and volumes					Normal Closure before FOI Act: 	30		C6418
