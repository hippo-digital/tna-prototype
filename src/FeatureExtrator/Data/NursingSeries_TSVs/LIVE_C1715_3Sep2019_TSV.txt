>>>    	ADM 6			Admiralty: Service Records, Registers, Returns and Certificates	The majority of this series consists of service records of sea, marine and naval officers. ¶ It includes commission and warrant books, succession books, and registers of shore appointments, as well as some service registers. There are collections of passing certificates for lieutenants and warrant officers, returns to the 1822 survey of officers' ages, and leave books. ¶ A large collection of volumes concerns applicants for admission to Greenwich Hospital. Another consists of the records of the Charity for the Relief of Sea Officers' Widows. Among the remaining records are nominations for naval cadetships and the parochial registers of some dockyard and barrack churches. ¶ PLEASE NOTE: Electronic images of selected pieces of these records can be searched online through our partner website. Pieces 418 and 420-422 only have been digitised at this time (February 2013); further releases to follow.	1673-1960	477 volume(s)			Other related material may be found in 		Normal Closure before FOI Act: 	30		C1715
