>>>    	MH 94			Lunacy Commission and Board of Control: Patients Admission Registers	This series contains registers kept by the Lunacy Commission, 1846 to 1913, and the Board of Control, 1913 to 1960. They record the name and sex of the patient, the name of hospital, asylum or licensed house, and the date of admission and of discharge, or death of each patient. Further information on the medical and legal circumstances of each patient was entered in the patients diaries, also preserved in this series. These note the receipt of medical statements and action to be taken, the receipt of a patient's right to see a judicial authority, the urgency of the case, and further remarks. Temporary and private patients' diaries vary a little in the information they provide.	1846-1960	228 volume(s)					Normal Closure before FOI Act: 	30		C10937
